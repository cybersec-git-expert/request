## 📊 API Testing Results

✅ Business Types: `GET /api/business-types?country_code=LK` - Working
✅ Form Data: `GET /api/business-registration/form-data?country_code=LK` - Working  
✅ Categories Hierarchy: `GET /api/business-registration/categories-hierarchy` - Working
🔒 Admin endpoints require authentication (as expected)

## 🎯 Next Steps for Frontend

1. **Flutter App Business Registration Form**
   - Use `/api/business-registration/form-data` to populate dropdowns
   - Replace free text business category with business type selection
   - Add categories multi-select for notification preferences

2. **Admin Panel Business Types Management**  
   - Create admin interface for business types CRUD
   - Country-specific business type management
   - Business type usage analytics

3. **Notification Targeting**
   - Update notification system to use new categories field
   - Test business-to-business notification targeting

## 🔧 Database Schema

```sql
-- New business_types table
CREATE TABLE business_types (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  icon VARCHAR(255),
  country_code VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'LK',
  display_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(name, country_code)
);

-- Updated business_verifications table
ALTER TABLE business_verifications 
ADD COLUMN business_type_id INTEGER REFERENCES business_types(id),
ADD COLUMN categories JSONB DEFAULT '[]';
```

The business types system is now fully implemented and ready for frontend integration! 🚀
