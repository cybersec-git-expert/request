# Price Comparison System - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive price comparison system where:
- **Businesses** can search for products from a centralized catalog and add their own pricing
- **Customers** can search for products and see the cheapest prices available from different businesses

## System Architecture

### Database Tables
1. **`master_products`** - Centralized product catalog (managed by super admin)
2. **`price_listings`** - Business pricing for products with delivery charges, images, and contact info
3. **`business_verifications`** - Verified businesses that can add pricing
4. **`brands`** - Product brands
5. **`categories/sub_categories`** - Product categorization

### API Endpoints

#### For Businesses (Authenticated Routes)
- **`POST /api/price-listings`** - Add a new price listing for a product
- **`PUT /api/price-listings/:id`** - Update existing price listing
- **`DELETE /api/price-listings/:id`** - Remove/deactivate price listing
- **`GET /api/price-listings?businessId=userId`** - Get all listings for a business

#### For Customers (Public Routes)
- **`GET /api/price-listings/search?q=product&country=LK`** - Search products available for price comparison
- **`GET /api/price-listings/product/:productId`** - Get all price listings for a specific product (sorted by price)
- **`GET /api/price-listings?country=LK&sortBy=price`** - Browse all price listings
- **`POST /api/price-listings/:id/track-view`** - Track when someone views a listing
- **`POST /api/price-listings/:id/track-contact`** - Track when someone contacts a business

## How It Works

### For Customers
1. **Search Products**: Customers search for products they want to compare prices for
2. **View Price Comparison**: System shows all available options sorted by total cost (price + delivery)
3. **Contact Businesses**: Customers can contact businesses directly via WhatsApp, website, or phone

    city_id UUID REFERENCES cities(id),
    country_code VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'LK',
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    view_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    contact_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
