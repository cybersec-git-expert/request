# Unified Phone & Email Verification System

## Overview
This document describes the unified verification system that eliminates redundant phone and email verifications across all user flows in the Request Marketplace application. The system checks verification status across personal, business, and driver contexts before requiring manual OTP verification.

## System Architecture

### Database Tables Used
1. **`users`** - Main user table with personal contact information
   - `phone` - Personal phone number
   - `phone_verified` - Personal phone verification status
   - `email` - Primary email address
   - `email_verified` - Email verification status

2. **`business_verifications`** - Business verification records
   - `phone_number` - Business phone number (normalized format)
   - `phone_verified` - Business phone verification status
   - `email` - Business email address
   - `email_verified` - Business email verification status
   - `phone_verified_at` - Timestamp of phone verification
   - `email_verified_at` - Timestamp of email verification

3. **`driver_verifications`** - Driver verification records
   - `phone_number` - Driver phone number (normalized format)
   - `phone_verified` - Driver phone verification status
   - `email` - Driver email address
   - `email_verified` - Driver email verification status
   - `phone_verified_at` - Timestamp of phone verification
   - `email_verified_at` - Timestamp of email verification

4. **`phone_otp_verifications`** - OTP verification records
   - `phone` - Phone number
   - `otp` - OTP code
   - `verified` - Verification status
   - `verified_at` - Verification timestamp

5. **`email_otp_verifications`** - Email OTP verification records
   - `email` - Email address
   - `otp` - OTP code
   - `verified` - Verification status
   - `verified_at` - Verification timestamp

### Removed Tables
- ❌ **`user_phone_numbers`** - No longer used (eliminated redundancy)
- ❌ **`user_email_addresses`** - No longer used (eliminated redundancy)

### Phone Number Classification
- **Personal Phone**: Stored in `users.phone`, used for account registration and login
- **Business Phone**: Stored in `business_verifications.phone_number`, used for business verification
- **Driver Phone**: Stored in `driver_verifications.phone_number`, used for driver verification

## Verification Logic

### Phone Verification Priority Order
The system follows this priority order for phone verification:

**For Business Verification:**
1. **Business Context Check**: Check if phone exists in `business_verifications` table as verified
   - If found and verified → Phone is verified
   - Source: `business_verification`, Priority: 1

2. **Driver Context Check**: Check if phone exists in `driver_verifications` table as verified  
   - If found and verified → Phone is verified (auto-update business context)
   - Source: `driver_verification`, Priority: 2

3. **Personal Context Check**: Check if phone matches user's personal phone and is verified
   - If matches and verified → Phone is verified
   - Source: `personal_verification`, Priority: 3

4. **Manual OTP Verification**: If no verification found, require manual OTP
   - Uses `phone_otp_verifications` table
   - Stores verification in appropriate context table

**For Driver Verification:**
1. **Driver Context Check**: Check if phone exists in `driver_verifications` table as verified
   - If found and verified → Phone is verified
   - Source: `driver_verification`, Priority: 1

2. **Business Context Check**: Check if phone exists in `business_verifications` table as verified
   - If found and verified → Phone is verified (auto-update driver context)
   - Source: `business_verification`, Priority: 2

3. **Personal Context Check**: Check if phone matches user's personal phone and is verified
   - If matches and verified → Phone is verified
   - Source: `personal_verification`, Priority: 3

4. **Manual OTP Verification**: If no verification found, require manual OTP

### Email Verification Priority Order
The system follows this priority order for email verification:

**For Business Verification:**
1. **Business Context Check**: Check if email exists in `business_verifications` table as verified
   - If found and verified → Email is verified
   - Source: `business_verification`, Priority: 1

2. **Driver Context Check**: Check if email exists in `driver_verifications` table as verified
   - If found and verified → Email is verified (auto-update business context)
   - Source: `driver_verification`, Priority: 2

3. **Personal Context Check**: Check if email matches user's personal email and is verified
   - If matches and verified → Email is verified
   - Source: `personal_verification`, Priority: 3

4. **Manual OTP Verification**: If no verification found, require manual OTP
   - Uses `email_otp_verifications` table
   - Stores verification in appropriate context table

**For Driver Verification:**
1. **Driver Context Check**: Check if email exists in `driver_verifications` table as verified
   - If found and verified → Email is verified
   - Source: `driver_verification`, Priority: 1

2. **Business Context Check**: Check if email exists in `business_verifications` table as verified
   - If found and verified → Email is verified (auto-update driver context)
   - Source: `business_verification`, Priority: 2

3. **Personal Context Check**: Check if email matches user's personal email and is verified
   - If matches and verified → Email is verified
   - Source: `personal_verification`, Priority: 3

4. **Manual OTP Verification**: If no verification found, require manual OTP

### Phone Number Normalization
All phone numbers are normalized to ensure consistent comparison:
- Input: `0725742238` → Normalized: `725742238`
- Input: `94725742238` → Normalized: `725742238`  
- Input: `+94725742238` → Normalized: `725742238`
- Removes country codes and special characters for comparison

### Return Object Structure
Both phone and email verification functions return:
```javascript
{
  phoneVerified: boolean,        // or emailVerified
  needsUpdate: boolean,          // Whether to update the current context
  requiresManualVerification: boolean,
  verificationSource: string,    // 'business_verification', 'driver_verification', 'personal_verification', 'otp'
  verifiedAt: timestamp         // When verification occurred (if available)
}
```
