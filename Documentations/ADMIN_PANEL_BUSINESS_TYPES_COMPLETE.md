## 🚀 API Endpoints Available

### **Public Endpoints (for mobile app):**
- `GET /api/business-types?country_code=LK` - Get active business types
- `GET /api/business-registration/form-data?country_code=LK` - Complete form data

### **Admin Endpoints (authenticated):**
- `POST /api/business-types/admin` - Create business type
- `PUT /api/business-types/admin/:id` - Update business type
- `DELETE /api/business-types/admin/:id` - Delete business type
- `POST /api/business-types/admin/copy` - Copy business types between countries (super admin only)

## 🎯 Next Steps for Mobile App

The Flutter app can now use these endpoints:
1. **Registration Form**: Use `/api/business-registration/form-data` to populate dropdowns
2. **Business Types**: Replace free text with admin-managed business type selection
3. **Categories**: Multi-select categories for notification targeting

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

- ✅ All admin endpoints require JWT authentication
- ✅ Country admins can only manage their country's business types
- ✅ Super admins have full access across all countries
- ✅ Uses existing permission structure (no database changes needed)

## 🎉 **Ready for Production!**

The business types management system is now fully integrated into the admin panel and ready for country admins to use. They can immediately start customizing business types for their countries, and the mobile app can use the new API endpoints for enhanced business registration forms.

**Test URL**: `http://localhost:5173/business-types` (when admin panel is running)
