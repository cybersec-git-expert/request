# üìö Documentation Index & Working Guide

## üö¶ Documentation Quality Status Legend

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| ‚úÖ Solid | Current + clear | Keep updated when code changes |
| üü° Needs Merge | Overlaps with another doc | Consolidate & redirect |
| üü† Stale | References outdated architecture | Refresh diagrams / flows |
| üî¥ Gap | Missing required doc | Create immediately |

## üîç Immediate Improvement Backlog (Sprint Candidate)

| Priority | Task | Docs Impacted | Outcome |
|----------|------|---------------|---------|
| P1 | Create unified `AUTHENTICATION_OVERVIEW.md` (merge phone/email/SMS) | FIREBASE_PHONE_AUTH_SETUP, CONTACT_VERIFICATION_IMPLEMENTATION, SMS_* | One authoritative auth flow diagram |
| P1 | Add role-permission matrix | COUNTRY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE, ROLE_REGISTRATION_SYSTEM | Faster onboarding for permissions |
| P2 | Introduce `CHANGELOG.md` and migrate fixes | FIXES_SUMMARY, EMAIL_VERIFICATION_FIX | Standard semantic versioning |
| P2 | Generate OpenAPI skeleton (YAML) | API_DOCUMENTATION | Easier client SDK generation |
| P3 | Merge roadmaps into single hierarchic file | COMPREHENSIVE_ROADMAP_2025, DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP | Reduced duplication |
| P3 | Add subscription flow state diagram | SUBSCRIPTION_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION | Clear monetization logic |
| P3 | Add ERD & sequence for vehicles auto-activation | VEHICLE_SYSTEM_STATUS | Architectural clarity |

## üõ†Ô∏è Working Conventions
- One feature = one primary doc + optional deep-dive (avoid scattered partials)
- Start each doc with: Purpose / Audience / Last Reviewed
- Use UTC dates (ISO 8601) for `Last Updated`
- Cross-link related docs via relative paths
- Prefer diagrams (PlantUML / Mermaid) stored inline or `/documentation/diagrams/`

## üß™ Verification Checklist When Updating Feature Docs
1. Architecture diagram matches current code modules
2. API endpoints listed exist in code (or marked Planned)
3. Security implications stated (auth, roles, rate limits)
4. Country filtering & multi-tenant impact covered
5. Migration/rollback notes (if schema involved)
6. Testing guidance (unit + integration + manual QA hints)

## üóÉÔ∏è Proposed New Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AUTHENTICATION_OVERVIEW.md` | Consolidated login/verification/SMS flows |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Versioned list of user-impacting changes |
| `PERMISSIONS_MATRIX.md` | Tabular role vs capability grid |
| `OPENAPI_SPEC.yaml` | Machine-readable API contract |
| `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` | High-level system diagram & modules |

## üß≠ Suggested Sequence (If We Work Continuously)
1. Add `CHANGELOG.md` & migrate recent fixes
2. Create `PERMISSIONS_MATRIX.md` from existing role docs
3. Build `AUTHENTICATION_OVERVIEW.md` (unify contact + SMS + email)
4. Normalize roadmaps into `ROADMAP_2025.md` (archive old)
5. Produce `OPENAPI_SPEC.yaml` scaffold (at least /health, auth, categories)
6. Architecture diagram + doc

Let me know which item to start next and I will create or refactor accordingly.
