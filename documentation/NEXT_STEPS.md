# FIREBASE CONFIG (if using)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-firebase-service-account-email
```

### 2. **Run Database Cleanup**

```powershell
# Test first (dry run)
.\run-database-cleanup.ps1 -DryRun

# Then run actual cleanup (BACKUP FIRST!)
.\run-database-cleanup.ps1
```

### 3. **Deploy Your Backend**

```powershell
# Deploy the backend
.\manual-deploy.ps1

# Or with specific version
.\manual-deploy.ps1 "v1.0.0"
```

### 4. **Build and Deploy Flutter App**

```powershell
# Navigate to Flutter app
cd request

# Build for production
