# How to Add Your Logo

## Step 1: Prepare Your Logo
- Save your blue-to-green gradient arrow logo as a PNG file
- Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or larger
- Name it: `app_logo.png`

## Step 2: Copy Logo to Assets Folder
Copy your `app_logo.png` file to this exact location:
```
/home/cyberexpert/Dev/request-marketplace/request/assets/images/app_logo.png
```

## Step 3: Restart the App
After placing the logo, restart the Flutter app:
```bash
cd /home/cyberexpert/Dev/request-marketplace/request
flutter run
```

## What Happens Next:
- Your actual logo will appear on the splash screen
- Your logo will appear on the welcome screen
- The logo will be used throughout the app
- If the image is not found, it will show a fallback gradient arrow

## File Structure:
```

â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images/
