# Country-Wise Implementation Guide

This document outlines the country-wise functionality implementation across the Request Marketplace platform.

## Overview
We've implemented country support across all major collections:
- âœ… Business registrations (already implemented)
- âœ… Driver registrations (already implemented)  
- ðŸ†• Requests collection
- ðŸ†• Responses collection
- ðŸ†• Price listings collection
- ðŸ†• Ride requests (part of requests)

## Database Changes

### Collections Updated
1. **requests** - Added `country` and `countryName` fields
2. **responses** - Added `country` and `countryName` fields
3. **price_listings** - Added `country` and `countryName` fields

### Migration Script
Run the migration script to add country information to existing records:
```bash
node add_country_support.js
```

## Flutter App Changes

### Models Updated
1. **RequestModel** - Added country and countryName fields
2. **ResponseModel** - Added country and countryName fields
3. **PriceListing** - Added country and countryName fields

### Services Updated
1. **EnhancedRequestService** - Now includes country info when creating requests/responses
2. **AddPriceListingScreen** - Now includes country info when creating price listings

## Country Filtering Implementation

### For Requests
```dart
// Filter requests by country
Query requestsQuery = FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('requests')
    .where('country', isEqualTo: userCountryCode);
```

### For Responses
```dart
// Filter responses by country
Query responsesQuery = FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('responses')
    .where('country', isEqualTo: userCountryCode);
```

### For Price Listings
```dart
// Filter price listings by country
Query priceListingsQuery = FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('price_listings')
    .where('country', isEqualTo: userCountryCode);
```

## Admin Panel Updates Needed

### Request Management
Update admin panels to filter requests by country:
- Country admins should only see requests from their country
- Super admins can see all countries
- Add country filter dropdown for super admins

### Response Management
Similar filtering for responses:
- Filter by responder's country
- Show country information in response listings

### Price Listings Management
For business/product management:
- Filter price listings by country
- Show business country in listings

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Request (automatically includes country)
```dart
final requestId = await requestService.createRequest(
  title: 'Need a ride',
  description: 'From airport to hotel',
  type: RequestType.ride,
  // country fields are automatically added from CountryService
);
```

### Creating a Response (automatically includes country)
```dart
final responseId = await requestService.createResponse(
  requestId: requestId,
  message: 'I can help with this',
  price: 1500.0,
  // country fields are automatically added from CountryService
);
```

### Creating a Price Listing (automatically includes country)
```dart
final priceListing = PriceListing(
  // ... other fields
  country: userCountryCode,
  countryName: userCountryName,
);
```

## Benefits

1. **Country-Specific Content**: Users only see relevant content for their country
2. **Admin Management**: Country admins can manage their region effectively
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new countries
4. **Data Integrity**: All new records automatically include country information
5. **Compliance**: Meets regional data requirements

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Run migration script to update existing data
2. ðŸ”„ Update admin React panels to include country filtering
3. ðŸ”„ Test country filtering functionality
4. ðŸ”„ Update mobile app to use country filtering in queries
5. ðŸ”„ Add country selection in admin interfaces

## Files Changed

### Flutter App
- `lib/src/models/request_model.dart` - Added country fields to RequestModel and ResponseModel
- `lib/src/models/price_listing.dart` - Added country fields to PriceListing
- `lib/src/services/enhanced_request_service.dart` - Added country service integration
- `lib/src/screens/pricing/add_price_listing_screen.dart` - Added country info to price listings

### Migration Scripts
- `add_country_support.js` - Migrates existing records to include country information

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify migration script updates existing records correctly
- [ ] Test new request creation includes country
- [ ] Test new response creation includes country  
- [ ] Test new price listing creation includes country
- [ ] Verify admin panels filter by country correctly
- [ ] Test country selection in admin interfaces
- [ ] Verify cross-country isolation works properly
