# Subscription Management System - How It Works

## Overview
The subscription system controls what features businesses get when they register on your platform. There are 3 main types of subscription plans:

## 1. **Basic Plan (Free)**
- **Cost**: Free (0 LKR)
- **What they get**: Limited responses per month (usually 3-5)
- **Perfect for**: Small businesses just trying out the platform

## 2. **Monthly Plan (Premium)**
- **Cost**: Fixed monthly fee (like 5000 LKR/month)
- **What they get**: Unlimited responses for that month
- **Perfect for**: Established businesses with steady customer flow

## 3. **Pay Per Click (PPC)**
- **Cost**: Pay only for responses they actually get
- **What they get**: Each response costs money (like 100 LKR per response)
- **Perfect for**: Businesses with unpredictable customer volume

## How to Set Up Subscriptions

### Step 1: Create Subscription Plans
1. Go to "Subscription Plans" tab
2. Click "Create New Plan"
3. Choose plan type (Basic/Monthly/Pay Per Click)
4. Set pricing:
   - Basic: Monthly Fee = 0, Cost Per Response = 0, Response Limit = 3
   - Monthly: Monthly Fee = 5000, Cost Per Response = 0, Response Limit = unlimited
   - Pay Per Click: Monthly Fee = 0, Cost Per Response = 100, Response Limit = unlimited

### Step 2: Assign Plans to Business Types
1. Go to "Plan Assignments" tab
2. Select which plan applies to which business type
3. For example:
   - Restaurants → Basic Plan (free to start)
   - Hotels → Monthly Plan (they need lots of responses)
   - Taxi Services → Pay Per Click (unpredictable volume)

## What Happens When a Business Registers?
1. They choose their business type (Restaurant, Hotel, etc.)
2. The system automatically assigns them the subscription plan you configured
3. They start getting responses according to their plan limits
4. You can change their plan later if needed

## Example Setup:
```
Restaurant (Business Type) → Basic Plan → 3 free responses/month
Hotel (Business Type) → Monthly Plan → Unlimited responses for 5000 LKR/month
Taxi (Business Type) → Pay Per Click → Pay 100 LKR per response
```

## Tips:
- Start with generous Basic plans to attract new businesses
- Use Monthly plans for businesses that need predictable costs
- Use Pay Per Click for seasonal or variable businesses
- You can always edit plans and pricing later
